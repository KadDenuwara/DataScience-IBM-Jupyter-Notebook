    "### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `3 + 2`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Addition combines two numbers into a single sum. In this example, 3 and 2 are added together to give the result 5.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 3 + 2\n",
    "     print(\"Addition: 3 + 2 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `7 - 4`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Subtraction takes one number away from another. Here, 4 is subtracted from 7, resulting in 3.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 7 - 4\n",
    "     print(\"Subtraction: 7 - 4 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `5 * 6`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Multiplication calculates the product of two numbers. In this case, 5 multiplied by 6 gives 30.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 5 * 6\n",
    "     print(\"Multiplication: 5 * 6 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Division**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `8 / 2`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Division splits one number by another. Here, 8 is divided by 2, resulting in 4. Note that division in Python returns a float by default.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 8 / 2\n",
    "     print(\"Division: 8 / 2 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponentiation**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `3 ** 2`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Exponentiation raises one number to the power of another. In this example, 3 raised to the power of 2 (3 squared) gives 9.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 3 ** 2\n",
    "     print(\"Exponentiation: 3 ** 2 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modulus**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `10 % 3`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: The modulus operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. Here, 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 10 % 3\n",
    "     print(\"Modulus: 10 % 3 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Floor Division**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `9 // 2`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Floor division divides one number by another and rounds down to the nearest whole number. In this case, 9 divided by 2 results in 4.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 9 // 2\n",
    "     print(\"Floor Division: 9 // 2 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Complex Number Addition**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `(3 + 2j) + (2 + 3j)`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Complex number addition combines the real and imaginary parts separately. In this example, `(3 + 2j) + (2 + 3j)` results in `5 + 5j`.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = (3 + 2j) + (2 + 3j)\n",
    "     print(\"Complex Addition: (3 + 2j) + (2 + 3j) =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Mixed Type Addition**:\n",
    "   - **Example**: `3 + 4.5`\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: When adding an integer and a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float and performs the addition. Here, `3 + 4.5` results in `7.5`.\n",
    "   - **Code**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 3 + 4.5\n",
    "     print(\"Mixed Type Addition: 3 + 4.5 =\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Order of Operations**:\n",
    "    - **Example**: `3 + 2 * 5`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: Python follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). In this example, multiplication is performed before addition, so `2 * 5` is evaluated first, resulting in `10`, and then `3 + 10` gives `13`.\n",
    "    - **Code**:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      result = 3 + 2 * 5\n",
    "      print(\"Order of Operations: 3 + 2 * 5 =\", result)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Parentheses for Order of Operations**:\n",
    "    - **Example**: `(3 + 2) * 5`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: Parentheses change the order of operations by ensuring that the expression within them is evaluated first. Here, `(3 + 2)` is evaluated to `5`, and then `5 * 5` gives `25`.\n",
    "    - **Code**:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      result = (3 + 2) * 5\n",
    "      print(\"Parentheses Order: (3 + 2) * 5 =\", result)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Negative Numbers**:\n",
    "    - **Example**: `-5 + 3`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: Arithmetic operations can include negative numbers. Here, `-5 + 3` results in `-2`.\n",
    "    - **Code**:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      result = -5 + 3\n",
    "      print(\"Negative Numbers: -5 + 3 =\", result)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate various arithmetic operations in Python, each with its own specific syntax and behavior. Understanding these basic operations is essential for performing more complex mathematical calculations and data manipulations."
